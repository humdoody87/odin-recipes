# odin-recipes
Hello world, my name is Ahmad, student of The Odin Project and I am currently working on a project where I will build a basic html document with recipes. 
It will not look pretty at first but as I read, will look better later once I am taught how to style it with CSS.
This will be fun and exciting.
